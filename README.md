# DIY 8x8x8 RGB LED cube

Thank you my friend Siew Goh Chuang, he made this beautiful LED cube:  This is a 8x8x8 RGB LED cube project, a modified version of the LED cube which originally designed by Kavindarrah, I only modified the hardware but leaving the software (source code) intact. All the source code is available in Kavindarrah's website.
